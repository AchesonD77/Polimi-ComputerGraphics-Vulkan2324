Some guides and summaries for Polimi's computer science's COMPUTER GRAPHICS(Vulkan).
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to the **COMPUTER GRAPHICS** exam, including **1_AssignmentCode, 2_Vulkan_Project, 3_HowtodeliverAssignment, and 4_InitialVulkanSource**.

# My voice!
1. My exam date was the 14th of January in 2025. I have been preparing for this exam from the 14th of November to the 26th of December. **(43 days, Half of each day)**
2. I wrote this repository beginning on the 7th of February, 2025 and end at 11th of March  **(4 days)**
4. I scored 30 points in this course, 8 points for assignments, and 22+ points for the project.
5. Because of the file size limit, 3 models, Joker2.obj, Spaceshuttle.obj, and vulkan initial source(which you need to download from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment) were deleted.

# Some Tips?
1. In **1_AssignmentCode**, it includes all the assignments I did. The name is Dan_A0N, and A0N is the initial version from the professor.
2. In **2_Vulkan_Project**, includes a pdf to introduce my project - 'CG-The Dark Knight's Quest for Justice', I use 5 different shaders to fulfill different Illumination effect, reflection effect, illumination color...
3. In **3_HowtodeliverAssignment**, They are the deliver files.
4. I downloaded the OBJ and texture from https://rigmodels.com/index.php#google_vignette. It is a good website to download the OBJs you want and which you can use in our vulkan and project.
5. For the obj you downloaded, you need to check the code of obj if it has vn, **if the code of obj doesn't have VN, we can not use it in our vulkan project.**
6. In **5_ScreenshotOfProjects**, I uploaded the screenshots from my project.
7. **About the project, you can directly see this PDF file.[CG-The Dark Knight's Quest for Justice.pdf](2_Vulkan_Project/CG-The Dark Knight's Quest for Justice.pdf)**
