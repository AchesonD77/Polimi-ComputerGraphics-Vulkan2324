# My voice!
1. My exam date was the 14th of January in 2025. I have been preparing for this exam from the 14th of November to the 26th of December. **(43 days, Half of each day)**
2. I wrote this on the 7th of February, 2025. **(1 days)**
4. I scored 30 points in this course, 8 points for assignments, 22+ points for project.
5. Because of the file size limit, 3 models, Joker2.obj, Spaceshuttle.obj, and vulkan initial source(which you need to download from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment) were deleted.

# Some Tips?
1. In AssignmentCode, it includes all the assignments I did, the name is Dan_A0N, and A0N are the initial version from professor.
2. In Vulkan_Project, includes a pdf to introduce my project - 'CG-The Dark Knight's Quest for Justice', I use 5 different shaders to fulfill different Illumination effect, reflection effect, illumination color...
3. I downloaded obj and texture from https://rigmodels.com/index.php#google_vignette, it is a good website to download what OBJs you want.
4. For the obj you downloaded, you need to check the code of obj if it has vn, **if the code of obj doesn't have VN, we can not use it in our vulkan project.**
